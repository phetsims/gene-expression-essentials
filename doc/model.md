Model Notes for Gene Expression Essentials
==========================================

Protein synthesis in living cells is a very complex process. The Gene Expression Essentials simulation depicts a version
of protein synthesis that is greatly simplified in order to present enough information for students to understand the
basics of the process without overwhelming them with they myriad details and variations.

Here are some of the simplifications that were made:

+ The process being portrayed does not show the mRNA moving out of the nucleus, and is thus essentially showing a
  prokaryotic, as opposed to a eukaryotic, cell.
+ The genes being transcribed are significantly shorter (in terms of the number of base pairs) than real-life genes. On
  average, a real gene in a prokaryotic organism is 1000 base pairs, whereas the genes in this simulation contain less
  than 100 base pairs.
+ Ribosomes are available to the user in "pre-assembled" form, meaning that the large and small subunits are already
  together, rather than having the subunits come together as mRNA transcription begins.
+ Individual amino acids are not depicted.
+ Transfer RNA (tRNA) is not depicted.
+ Protein folding is not depicted.
+ The sizes and shapes of the biomolecules were inspired by the drawing in "The Machinery of Life" by David S. Goodsell.
